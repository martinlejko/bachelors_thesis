# Embedding
  * Type of vector, (big,small,animal tree) compass
  * Turning data into vector in hundres of dimensions by some software
  * After turning it into Vector embedding --> Vector database

# YT video: Knowledge embedding
  * Case study --> generating the customer replies with companies best practice
  * [youtube vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_nCjlSB1Zk&list=PLd6t9g4NfNFrM69CYx56NzwG1gbOAw3uO)
  * Using a *text-splitter* for big chunk of data, that we will have
  * For embidding he uses *OpenAIEmbeddings* and also *FAISS*
  * Use of a third-party website for sharing

# Medium series about LLM
  * [medium](https://cismography.medium.com/knowledge-bases-and-retrieval-augmented-llms-a-primer-c054db532b91)
  
  * What is *langchain*?
    * Open-source framework that makes it easier to build applications LLM
  * Using *langchain* with [gpt4all](https://gpt4all.io/index.html)
  * use of *langchain* as the embedder here [embedding LLM with langchain](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/implementation-knowledge-base-embedding-llm-flexidigit-technologies-8hqmc)

* How does vector databse work?
  * Each entity is represented as a high-dimensional vector and the similarity between entities is calculated based on vecotr distance

* Nice source of material and frameworks: [llamahub](https://llamahub.ai/)
* Plaban Nayak [k graph vs vector db](https://medium.aiplanet.com/implement-rag-with-knowledge-graph-and-llama-index-6a3370e93cdd) tried to connect with him
