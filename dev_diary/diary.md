#### **Research and Exploration**

Today, I started researching how to approach my thesis on private LLMs, with a focus on the general thing as I have never dabled into LLM's and AI before. Since I prefer visual content over text, I began by watching YouTube videos on private LLMs. This gave me a basic overview and introduced me to the concept of *fine-tuning* models. I then sought more specific information, such as LLMs with business knowledge. A particularly helpful video was [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_nCjlSB1Zk&list=PLd6t9g4NfNFrM69CYx56NzwG1gbOAw3uO), which provided new perspectives and a clearer direction for my thesis. New terms such as *knowledge embedding* came up, making me realize that fine-tuning will only be a final touch if time permits. The first major task is to gather information and input it into my LLM.

#### **New Concepts and Terms**

I encountered several new concepts today. *Fine-tuning* involves customizing a pre-trained model to perform specific tasks using additional training, while *knowledge embedding* is about integrating specific knowledge into the LLM to enhance its performance and relevance. These concepts will be crucial for my thesis as it involves providing the private info we want into the LLM. Fine-tuning will be more of a cherry on top kind of thing. :)

#### **Challenges and Concerns**

One significant concern is the potential for leaking company information while conducting research on LLMs and their application. Additionally, understanding the technical details of knowledge embedding and fine-tuning in the context of LLMs presents a challenge.
Also I am kind of woried as there will not be enought of good open-source code for the implementaiton and the privacy of the data will create a big challange.

#### **Reflections and Insights**

Moving forward, I plan to continue researching methods for gathering and embedding business-specific information into an LLM. I will also identify more resources that discuss the privacy aspects of LLMs. Long-term, I aim to develop a comprehensive approach for embedding business knowledge into an LLM and plan the fine-tuning process as the concluding step of the thesis.

#### **Research and Exploration**

What I had planned previously, I have now accomplished. I explored the methods of knowledge embedding, as I believe it will be a crucial part of my thesis. Some new terms and ways poped up. I have not dived into very scientific papers as I am not ready for this now and I am firstly testing the watters and getting a wider understanding of the concepts.
